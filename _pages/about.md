My name is Hou Ningning. I am a Lecturer (Assistant Prof) at Macquarie University(Sydney, Australia). Before joining Macquarie University, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2021 from PolyU under the supervision of [Prof. Yuanqing Zheng](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csyqzheng/). Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2017. <br/>
Feel free to contact me at [ningning.hou@mq.edu.au].

I am looking for self-motivated PhD students, and research staff in all levels to work on exciting research projects related to Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), LPWANs, edge computing, wireless networking, security, and privacy. If you are interested in any of these or other research topics, please feel free to contact me.

Scholarships
======
------
-- Successful applicants will receive a tax-free scholarship of about $38，500 per annum PLUS a free tuition fee of 3 years for a PhD.

-- 2 years for Master Research (MRes) may also get a living allowance from project money. Outstanding students with a Bachelor's degree can apply for MRes year-2 directly.

-- A PhD student enrolled in an overseas university can apply for the [cotutelle PhD program (联合培养双学位)](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/phd-and-research-degrees/explore-research-degrees/global-research-training/global-phd-programs) at Macquarie. A successful applicant can receive a scholarship with the same rate of about $38,500 per annum (2024 rate) for 1-2 years. After graduation, the student can be awarded PhD degrees from the overseas home university and Macquarie University. 

-- An applicant from China can also apply for CSC (Chinese Scholarship Council) scholarship. If granted, Macquaire covers tuition fees (45k AUD per year) and both CSC and Macquarie will provide a stipend (38,500 AUD per annum) for the entire program. Both CSC visiting students and research fellows are also welcome！


-- A Ph.D. student could receive up to $7.5k for attending international conferences (5,000 AUD from the university and 2,500 AUD from the department) during the program.
